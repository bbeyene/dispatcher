I have been a squad boss for a few years with a forest firefighting contractor. I don't know what the situation is like when other contractors get a dispatch order but from my experience - its slightly chaotic. Maybe some already have software that streamlines this process but since mine didn't, I made one in Java and the company I worked for uses it. 

Before they started using it, this was a typical scenario: you have your company manifest spreadsheet and the manifest form word doc open side-by-side, then you copy-paste from one to the other. You make phone calls to assemble crews of 20 firefighters times however many crews you were ordered for - with particular qualifications necessary to fill each slot - something that takes all night for contractors that often have 100 - 200 firefighters on call. When firefighters don't show up, too many showed up or the right qualifications don't match up, moving them around and assigning them to different crews might get messy as you try to keep track of each firefighter. 

This is a desktop app that imports your firefighters' contact information, company manifest excel file as well as your vehicles list, builds a form filler with drop-downs and empty fields, then exports a filled PDF form that can still be edited after saving (swap a firefighter out, update quals, etc). As you choose personnel, it locks them in so that for example a 'FFT2' that was selected for one slot in one manifest wont be available for another slot or another manifest. It does not modify your existing files because you probably have "a system" for the way you store your files and generally handle other logistics (which the state also requires) - the app treats your excel files as the database so as not to mess with your workflow (nor involve making/using another spreadsheet).

To alert the firefighters, it uses Twilio to make automated calls and/or send text messages to all of them at the same. The contractor used this feature for company-wide notifications like upcoming trainings and reminders.
